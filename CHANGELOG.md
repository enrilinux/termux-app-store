## [v0.4.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- `fast_install.py` — new fast install engine: download pre-built `.deb` directly from mirror pool instead of compiling from source; supports mirror fallback, local `.deb` cache (TTL 7 days), progress callback, and SHA256 verification via `sha256_by_arch`
- `fast_install.py` — `_is_prebuilt_deb()`: detects package type from `SRCURL`; packages with `.deb` SRCURL (e.g. `basic`) are downloaded directly from developer's official release URL with SHA256 verification; source packages download from pool mirror
- `fast_install.py` — `_resolve_srcurl()`: expands `${TERMUX_PKG_VERSION}` variable in SRCURL so download URLs are always resolved correctly
- `tools/mirrors.json` — new mirror registry: defines primary (GitHub Pages), Cloudflare CDN, jsDelivr CDN, and raw GitHub as fallback mirrors; also stores `binary_cache` and `incremental_build` config
- `termux_app_store_cli.py` — `cmd_search <query>` / `find <query>`: search packages by name or description, shows version + install status per result
- `termux_app_store_cli.py` — `fix-install <pkg>` / `--fix-install <pkg>`: force install using `build-package.sh` from source, bypassing fast install and cache
- `termux_app_store_cli.py` — multi-package install: `install` now accepts multiple package names (`tas install tdoc pymaker baxter`), installs sequentially, prints summary
- `termux_app_store_cli.py` — multi-package uninstall: `uninstall` / `remove` now accepts multiple package names, uninstalls sequentially, prints summary
- `termux_app_store.py` — TUI system commands added: `Check mirrors`, `Cache info`, `Clear cache` accessible from Command Palette
- `termux_app_store.py` — `run_build_sync()` replaced with fast install engine: install button now downloads pre-built `.deb` from mirror instead of compiling
- `core/binary_core.py` — `BinaryCache` class: manages local `.deb` cache, downloads from mirrors, verifies SHA256, cleans expired entries; uses only stdlib (no aiohttp)
- `core/mirrors.py` — `MirrorManager` + `Mirror` dataclass: loads mirror list from `tools/mirrors.json`, provides `get_best_mirror()` and `get_enabled_mirrors()`
- `core/package.py` — `Package` dataclass for structured package metadata
- `core/validator.py` — `PackageValidator` + `validate_package()`: validates package metadata completeness
- `core//__init__.py` — new subpackage init exposing `BinaryCache`, `MirrorManager`, `Mirror`, `Package`, `PackageValidator`
- `utils/__init__.py` — new subpackage init exposing `install_from_binary`, `install_from_source`
- `utils/installer.py` — `install_from_binary()` and `install_from_source()` helpers
- `termux_app_store/__init__.py` — fixed to import from `core.binary_core` (was `binary_cache` — module did not exist)
- `build-packages-debs.yml` — new workflow: builds pre-built `.deb` for all packages using **QEMU aarch64 emulation** (`uraimo/run-on-arch-action`), producing native aarch64 binaries that actually run on Android/Termux; publishes to `gh-pages/pool/main/`
- `build-packages-debs.yml` — `Update index.json with .deb SHA256 hashes` step: writes `sha256_by_arch` field per package into `gh-pages/tools/index.json` so `fast_install.py` can verify `.deb` integrity per arch
- `update_index.yml` — new step `Trigger build-packages-debs`: after `index.json` is updated, automatically dispatches `build-packages-debs.yml` via GitHub API for changed packages; prevents `[skip ci]` from blocking the build trigger
- `install.sh` — official source protection now uses `/repos/{owner}/{repo}` endpoint instead of `/releases/latest` (which has no `full_name` field); verification now works correctly
- `install.sh` — `check_existing()` pipe-safe: detects `curl | bash` execution via `[ -t 0 ]`, auto-overwrites existing install instead of hanging on `read`
- `tasctl` — `verify_official_source()` protection added: blocks all commands (`install`, `update`, `doctor`, etc.) if run from a fork or renamed copy; only `help` is exempt
- `termux-build/tools/termux-build-create-index.sh` — per-package `index.json` now outputs `"package"` field (consistent with `fast_install.py`), `srcurl`, `sha256`, and correct `source.url` from `TERMUX_PKG_SRCURL` instead of homepage
- GitHub Issue templates: `package-request.md`, `package-request.yml`, `package-submission.md`, `package-submission.yml`
- `build-packages-debs.yml` — `build-packages-debs.yml` — `cmd_search`, `fix-install`, multi install/uninstall added to `CMD_ALIASES`
- `build-packages-debs.yml` — `Purge old .deb files from pool` step: when `force=true`, removes old `.deb` for specific package or all packages before rebuild
- Package `fuckshitup` v1.0.0 - php-cli vulnerability scanner
- Package `get` v1.0.0 - Simple script to retrieve IP from hostname or vice-versa
- Package `gobuster` v3.8.2 - Directory/File, DNS and VHost busting tool written in Go
- Package `killchain` v1.0.0 - auto-packaged by termux-build-init
- `tas` command — shorthand entry point for `termux-app-store`; `tas` opens TUI, `tas <args>` runs CLI

### Changed
- `termux_app_store_cli.py` — `cmd_install` fully refactored: now **only** uses `fast_install.py`; all fallback to `build-package.sh` removed from install path; if fast install fails, user is directed to `fix-install` instead
- `termux_app_store_cli.py` — `cmd_install_multi` / `cmd_uninstall_multi`: wraps single install/uninstall with sequential loop and summary output
- `termux_app_store_cli.py` — `cmd_help` updated: documents `search`, `fix-install`, multi install/uninstall, `mirrors`, `cache info/clear`
- `termux_app_store_cli.py` — `CMD_ALIASES` updated: `search`/`find`, `fix-install`/`--fix-install`, `remove` (alias for uninstall) added
- `termux_app_store_cli.py` — SHA256 verification now only uses `sha256_by_arch.get(arch)` (`.deb` hash per arch); never falls back to `sha256` field (source tarball hash), preventing false mismatch on every CDN download
- `fast_install.py` — `get_cached_deb()`: SHA256 parameter is now optional; if not provided, only TTL is checked; prevents false cache invalidation when `sha256_by_arch` is absent
- `build-termux-repo.yml` — `Regenerate Packages index` and `Release` steps rewritten in Python (inline `<<'EOF'`); removes bash heredoc `{ echo ... }` that caused YAML parse errors and `unexpected end of file`
- `build-packages-debs.yml` — prebuilt `.deb` packages (SRCURL ends in `.deb`) now download official `.deb` from developer, extract contents, repackage per-arch with correct control file; no longer passed through compile pipeline
- `build-packages-debs.yml` — `TERMUX_PKG_SRCURL` variable expansion now correctly resolves `${TERMUX_PKG_VERSION}` before download; previously URLs contained literal `${TERMUX_PKG_VERSION}` causing 404
- `update_index.yml` — commit message remains `[skip ci]` to prevent infinite loop; build trigger moved to explicit API dispatch instead of push trigger
- `termux-build/termux-build` — removed duplicate `Usage:` block in `*)` case that printed usage twice
- `termux-build/tools/termux-build-create.sh` — fixed typo `build-packages.sh` → `build-package.sh`
- `termux-build/tools/termux-build-init.sh` — `set -uo pipefail` → `set -euo pipefail` so errors in subcommands are caught
- Cloudflare deployment — migrated from Workers (which required `wrangler deploy` and failed with missing config) to **Cloudflare Pages** serving static `gh-pages` branch directly; `index.html` now live at `termux-app-store.pages.dev`

### Fixed
- `install.sh` — `verify_official_release()` used `/releases/latest` endpoint which has no `full_name` field; `grep '"full_name"'` always returned empty → verification always failed with "UNOFFICIAL SOURCE" block even on official repo; fixed by switching to `/repos/{owner}/{repo}` endpoint
- `install.sh` — `check_existing()` hung indefinitely when run via `curl | bash` because `read -r resp` got EOF from pipe stdin; fixed with `[ -t 0 ]` guard and `read -r resp </dev/tty`
- `fast_install.py` — SHA256 mismatch on every download: `sha256` field in `index.json` is the source tarball hash (used by `build-package.sh`), not the `.deb` hash; comparing against it always failed; fixed to only verify when `sha256_by_arch` is present
- `fast_install.py` — `ttyper` installed but `Exec format error`: QEMU-built `.deb` had x86_64 binary repackaged as aarch64 by only changing `Architecture:` field in control file; fixed in workflow — no more repackaging, binary must be native
- `fast_install.py` — `tdoc` installed but command not found: launcher was missing from `.deb` because `termux_step_make_install()` did not create `/usr/bin/tdoc`; fixed in `build-package.sh`
- `fast_install.py` — corrupt `.deb` from HTTP 403 returning HTML left in cache; subsequent runs got cache HIT on corrupt file; fixed by deleting cached file on `dpkg -i` failure
- `core/binary_core.py` — imported `aiohttp` (not available in Termux without extra install) and `utils.logger`/`utils.verifier` (modules that do not exist); replaced with stdlib `urllib.request` and `logging`
- `core/mirrors.py` — imported `utils.logger` (does not exist); replaced with `logging.getLogger(__name__)`; also fixed path `\~` → `~` (backslash caused `Path.expanduser()` to fail)
- `core/validator.py` — imported `utils.logger`; replaced with stdlib `logging`; `logger.success()` replaced with `logger.info()` (not a stdlib method)
- `utils/installer.py` — imported `logger` from relative `.logger` module (does not exist); replaced with stdlib `logging`
- `termux_app_store/__init__.py` — imported `binary_cache` module (does not exist); corrected to `core.binary_core`
- `core/__init__.py` — file did not exist; Python subpackage was not importable
- `utils/__init__.py` — file did not exist; Python subpackage was not importable
- `build-packages-debs.yml` — `Regenerate Packages index` step: bash heredoc `{ echo ... }` caused `unexpected end of file` at line 40 due to YAML/shell conflict; rewritten in Python
- `build-packages-debs.yml` — QEMU container did not create Termux prefix tree (`/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin`, `lib`, etc.); `termux_step_make_install()` failed writing to `$TERMUX_PREFIX/bin`; full prefix tree + tool symlinks now created before build
- `build-packages-debs.yml` — permission denied on `*.deb.sha256` files: SHA256 generated inside QEMU container (root), host runner could not write; fixed by generating SHA256 inside QEMU and running `chmod -R 777 output/` before exiting container
- `build-packages-debs.yml` — `TERMUX_PKG_SRCURL` variable not expanded: URLs containing `${TERMUX_PKG_VERSION}` were passed as-is to `curl`, resulting in 404; added bash string replacement to expand variable before download
- `build-packages-debs.yml` — `docker/setup-qemu-action` and `uraimo/run-on-arch-action` pinned to invalid commit hashes; replaced with valid version tags `@v3` and `@v2`
- `packages/crowbar/build.sh` — `termux_step_make_install()` copied all files to `lib/crowbar/` but never created `/usr/bin/crowbar` launcher; added launcher: `exec python3 .../crowbar.py`
- `packages/termux-tui/build.sh` — launcher called `app.py` which does not exist; actual entrypoint is `main.py`; fixed launcher path
- `packages/bower/build.sh` — `npm install` ran after `cp` to dest, so `node_modules` was inside dest (not staged for `.deb`); reordered to run `npm install` in source dir first, then `cp -r source/. dest/` so `node_modules` is included in `.deb`
- `termux-build-create-index.sh` — typo in error message: `'\( pkg_name' \)'` → `'$pkg_name'`
- `termux-build-create-index.sh` — `source.url` used `$homepage` instead of `TERMUX_PKG_SRCURL`; fixed to extract and use correct source URL

### Fixed
- `termux-build-init.sh` — `detect_entrypoint()` step 3: regex in `sed` for parsing `AC_INIT(...)` from `configure.ac` was malformed (`\[\?\([^],)]*\)\]`), causing m4 macro internals like `m4_defn([package_name])` to leak into the entrypoint result (e.g. detected as `m4-defn-package` instead of the actual binary name); regex corrected to `\[*\([^]],)]*\)` and an output validation guard added to reject strings containing `m4_`, `defn`, `$`, `(`, `)`, or `@`
- `termux-build-init.sh` — `scan_python_declared_deps()`: lines starting with `-` in `requirements.txt` (e.g. `-i https://pypi.org/simple`, `--index-url`, `-r`, `-f`) were not filtered and leaked into pip dependency list; added `[[ "$line" =~ ^[[:space:]]*- ]] && continue` guard before processing
- `termux-build-init.sh` — `map_python_dep()`: `socketserver` (lowercase, Python 3 stdlib module) was not in the stdlib filter list, causing it to be included as a pip install target; added to stdlib whitelist alongside `SocketServer`
- `termux-build-init.sh` — `make_install_block()` autotools case: no `termux_step_make_install()` was generated in the output `build.sh`, so `build-package.sh` fell back to auto-detect mode which incorrectly picked the `compile` helper file (an automake utility) instead of the actual built binary; a proper `termux_step_make_install()` using `make install PREFIX=` is now always emitted for autotools packages
- `build-package.sh` — `bash -n "$BUILD_SH"` exit code was silently lost: the result was captured into `_SYNTAX_ERR=$(...)` which always sets `$?` to 0, so syntax errors in `build.sh` were never caught; fixed by capturing exit code separately into `_SYNTAX_EXIT=$?`
- `build-package.sh` — `TERMUX_PKG_DEPENDS` was split via `tr` into a plain string `_DEPS_NORMALIZED` then used unquoted in `for` loop and `pkg install`, causing incorrect word splitting when package names contained spaces or special characters; replaced with `mapfile -t _DEPS_ARRAY` and `"${_DEPS_ARRAY[@]}"` throughout
- `build-package.sh` — `local _pd` used inside a `| while read` subshell within `_check_rust_env()`; semantically wrong outside a direct function body; removed `local`, variable now declared plainly as `_pd=$(dirname "$_ct")`
- `build-package.sh` — staging paths were inconsistent: ELF, npm, and auto-detect modes used `$WORK_DIR/pkg/$PREFIX` (double slash since `PREFIX` starts with `/`), while custom install mode used `$WORK_DIR/pkg$PREFIX` (correct); standardized all paths to `$WORK_DIR/pkg$PREFIX` to ensure all staged files land in the same directory tree that `dpkg-deb` packages
- `build-package.sh` — `dpkg-deb --build ... | tee "$DPKG_LOG"` caused `DPKG_EXIT` to always be 0 because the `if` condition evaluated the exit code of `tee` (always succeeds), not `dpkg-deb`; even with `set -o pipefail` active this pattern is unreliable; replaced with direct redirect `> "$DPKG_LOG"` and explicit `DPKG_EXIT=$?` capture
- `build-package.sh` — `termux_step_pre_configure()` defined in `build.sh` (e.g. running `autoreconf -fi` for autotools packages) was never called by `build-package.sh`, causing autotools builds to fail at `./configure` with missing generated files; added an explicit call block before `termux_step_make()` that `cd`s into `$SRC_ROOT` and invokes the function when declared
- `termux-build-init.sh` — all color variables now use `$'\033[...'` syntax so escape sequences are correctly interpreted by `printf` and `echo`; previously colors appeared as raw text like `\033[97m`
- `termux-build-init.sh` — Unicode characters in banner (`·`) and status tags (`✓`, `─`) now render correctly instead of showing as `\u00b7`, `\u2713`, `\u2500`
- `termux-build-init.sh` — output style unified with `build-package.sh`: same colors, same tag format `[✓]` `[INFO]` `[!]` `[FAIL]`, same `— Section —` style, same `─` line separator
- `termux-build-init.sh` — fail message "Cek nama branch atau pastikan repo tidak private" translated to English and reformatted to match tag style
- `build-package.sh` — `_line_heavy()` and `_line_thin()` fixed: replaced `tr ' ' '─'` with `printf '%.0s─' $(seq 1 $w)` to correctly render multi-byte Unicode separator characters
- `termux-build-init.sh` — when `INSTALL_METHOD=unknown`, tool now detects if the repo is a build-scripts/patch collection (contains `scripts/`, `patches/`, or `cmake/` directories with no runnable file in root) and sets `_BUILD_SCRIPTS_ONLY=true`
- `termux-build-init.sh` — when `INSTALL_METHOD=unknown` and repo is build-scripts only, a red warning box is shown: *"This repo is not a standalone tool — packaging will produce a .deb with no usable command"*; prompt defaults to **N** (abort)
- `termux-build-init.sh` — when `INSTALL_METHOD=unknown` but repo is not build-scripts only, a yellow warning box is shown: *"Could not detect build system — edit build.sh manually before test build"*; prompt also defaults to **N**
- `termux-build-init.sh` — test build is automatically skipped when `INSTALL_METHOD=unknown`; user is shown a message to edit `build.sh` first before running `bash build-package.sh <name>`
- `termux-build-init.sh` — `detect_method()` wrong priority: `Makefile` was checked before `pyproject.toml`, causing Python repos that also have a `Makefile` (e.g. `parllama`) to be detected as `make` method and fail with `No makefile found`
- `termux-build-init.sh` — `map_python_dep()` had many incorrect pip package names and stdlib modules slipping through: `yaml` → `PyYAML`, `click_default_group` → `click-default-group`, `xdg_base_dirs` → `xdg-base-dirs`, `dotenv` → `python-dotenv`; `asyncio`, `bisect`, `toml` should be filtered as stdlib
- `termux-build-init.sh` — `pip install .` used `--no-deps` so dependencies declared in `pyproject.toml` were not installed, causing `ModuleNotFoundError` at runtime (e.g. `elia`: `click_default_group` not installed)
- `termux-build-init.sh` — `pip_extra_cmd` installed all dependencies in one batch with `|| true`, so if one package name was wrong the entire batch failed silently
- `build-package.sh` — auto-detect mode: ELF binary check now runs **before** `cp`, preventing `Permission denied` errors when zip contains compiled executables
- `build-package.sh` — auto-detect mode: ELF binaries are now installed directly to `bin/` using `install -m755` instead of `cp -r` of the entire repo
- `build-package.sh` — auto-detect mode: non-ELF files retain `cp -r` to `lib/` with a file-by-file fallback in case any individual file fails to copy
- `build-package.sh` — `termux_step_make()` only ran `cd` to source when `TERMUX_PKG_BUILD_IN_SRC=true`; now always `cd "$SRC_ROOT"` before running make
- `termux_app_store.py` — `Input` search bar was placed outside `#body`, so on maximize only the search bar appeared and the left/right panels were not visible
- `termux_app_store.py` — `on_mount` used `await asyncio.to_thread(self.load_packages, True)` which blocked the initial render, causing the UI to appear blank on startup while waiting for GitHub fetch to complete
- `termux_app_store.py` — `ContactScreen` crashed with `MarkupError` because the `[link=https://...]` tag is not supported by Rich markup; URLs containing `://` were parsed incorrectly
- `termux_app_store_cli.py` — display CLI new interface

### Changed
- `pkg-scaffold.py` — auto-detect build method from repo file tree via GitHub API before Step 4 (checks for `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `Makefile`, `Gemfile`, etc.)
- `pkg-scaffold.py` — auto-detected method is pre-selected as default in the build method menu, user just presses Enter to confirm
- `pkg-scaffold.py` — default branch is fetched dynamically from GitHub API (`default_branch` field), so repos using `master`, `main`, or any custom branch are handled correctly; `"main"` is only used as fallback when offline
- `pkg-scaffold.py` — Step 5 (entrypoint) is automatically skipped for methods that don't need it (`cargo`, `go`, `npm`, `cmake`, `make`, `pip`), with a short message explaining the skip
- `pkg-scaffold.py` — warning displayed in Next Steps when `python-script` method is selected, reminding user to verify the entrypoint file exists and suggesting the correct method if build fails
- `build-termux-repo.yml` — nav bar: fixed horizontal overflow on mobile; `nav-inner` now uses `width:100%; box-sizing:border-box; overflow:hidden`
- `build-termux-repo.yml` — nav tabs now use `flex:1; min-width:0; overflow-x:auto` so tabs scroll horizontally instead of clipping the viewport
- `build-termux-repo.yml` — active nav tab now has a blue background highlight with top border radius for visual clarity
- `build-termux-repo.yml` — `.wrap` container now has `overflow-x:hidden` to prevent code blocks and cards from leaking outside the page on mobile
- `build-termux-repo.yml` — `.install-option` cards now have `overflow:hidden; box-sizing:border-box` to stay within screen bounds
- `build-termux-repo.yml` — `.step-body` now uses `min-width:0; overflow:hidden` to prevent flex children from overflowing on the Contribute page
- `build-termux-repo.yml` — Contribute page restructured: Fork & Clone and Create Branch steps moved above Automatic/Manual sections as shared prerequisites
- `build-termux-repo.yml` — Contribute page: "Automatic" and "Manual" section labels no longer use emoji icons
- `build-termux-repo.yml` — Contribute page: `./termux-build template` command no longer requires `<your-tool-name>` argument
- `build-termux-repo.yml` — Contribute page: `git push origin master` corrected to `git push origin <your-branch>`
- `build-termux-repo.yml` — Contribute page: removed `# Fork via GitHub UI, then:` comment from code block
- `build-termux-repo.yml` — Contribute page: `git checkout -b <your-branch>` added as a dedicated step after clone
- `termux_app_store_cli.py` — redesigned CLI output: all messages indented 2 spaces for cleaner alignment
- `termux_app_store_cli.py` — replaced `[*]`, `[✔]`, `[✗]`, `[!]` prefix tags with clean `✔` `✗` `↑` symbols
- `termux_app_store_cli.py` — `cmd_install` and `cmd_uninstall` now display a `─` bordered header section
- `termux_app_store_cli.py` — `cmd_version` redesigned with `━` box border showing installed and latest versions
- `termux_app_store_cli.py` — `cmd_show` redesigned with `━` box border for package details
- `termux_app_store_cli.py` — `cmd_help` restructured into a bordered box with grouped command sections
- `termux_app_store_cli.py` — `cmd_list` footer changed from inline total to a separate line with `─` separator
- `termux_app_store_cli.py` — `cmd_upgrade` list and summary now use bordered sections with `─` separators
- `termux_app_store_cli.py` — all status/progress messages shortened and made consistent across commands
- `tasctl` sync with pypi for update and wrapper
- `termux_app_store_cli.py` sync tasctl and pypi
- Package `termux-tui` v1.0.2 - Updated metadata
- `termux-build-init.sh` — `pip install .` now tries with full deps first, falls back to `--no-build-isolation`, then finally `--no-deps` as last resort
